<p>Muscle car is a description used for a high-performance American car, 
    by some definitions an intermediate sized car fitted with a large displacement V8 engine. Historically they were all rear-wheel
     drive, but that changed with technological advances.
    Although the term was unknown for another fifteen-plus years, General Motors is credited by some as 
    introducing the first <span style="color: green;">"intentional" muscle car in 1949, when it put its 303-cubic-inch (5 l) Rocket V8 from its full-sized
     luxury car 98 model into the considerably smaller and lighter Oldsmobile 88.[1] By some accounts, the "muscle car"</span> term proper
      was originally applied to mid-1960s and early 1970s special editions of mass-production cars which were designed for drag
       racing,[2] though it shortly entered the general vocabulary through car magazines and automobile marketing and became used
        generically for "performance"-oriented street cars.</p>
